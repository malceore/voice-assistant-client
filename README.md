# Whisper Voice Assistant Client

This project holds the code and automation scripts for the client of my always listening voice assistant. It leverages Snowboyhot word for the wakeword and Whipser server for complex language transcription. The goal of this project is to give an alternative to closed source, cloud based voice asssitant spyware that allows for the customization of hotwords to be whatever you want. 

## Getting Started

Disclaimer: This project is still in ongoing beta, support is highly limited.

## Installing

Please clone the latest source onto your Linux-based OS, I've tested this on most Raspberry Pi instances aswell as a lubuntu Laptop. In the scripts directory you will see a 'reinstall' script, review and execute this script to install prereqs. This repository is simply the 'client' software, you will also need to install Whipser Server and Pocketpshinx on a heavier server or VPS which has it's installation described in the below repository.

## I want to contribute

Yeah feel free to create PRs for things and I'll review them when I can. But since the best automation is the kind you write for yourself it may just be more valuable too create your models and your own skills.
